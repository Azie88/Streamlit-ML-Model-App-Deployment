# Streamlit-ML-Model-App-Deployment
Creating an app for a ML regression model to allow non-technical people to interact with it.

## Project Outline
- Exploring streamlit framework
- Building basic UI with inputs and outputs
- Importing the model with other requirements (Scaler, encoder etc.)
- Retrieving and processing input values
- Passing processed data through ML model to predict
- Format prediction output and send to UI
